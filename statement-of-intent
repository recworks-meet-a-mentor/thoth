MaM - Thoth - Statement of Intent < 3 minute read

Notes

⦁ Novice, in this context, refers to a person who has some coding experience and intends to start work as a software developer, or similar role
⦁ This document makes general assumptions based on my experience and conversations. I welcome suggestions and / or refinement

Goals

⦁ To help novices navigate the world of working in software development
⦁ To help mentors prepare novice mentees for working in software development

Suppositions

⦁ Novices face non-coding challenges in the workplace
⦁ Learning to code / coding on your own is significantly different from doing so in work
⦁ Novices are often unprepared for responsibilities and difficult scenarios in software development
⦁ This can cause significant stress, lack of productivity, and heighten imposter syndrome
⦁ To expect novices to read several books on the below subjects is probably impractical, inefficient, and counter-productive
⦁ An umbrella scheme to teach necessary skills is probably better than approaching them separately
⦁ Preparing novices for these unknowns in a hands-on manner would benefit them, if for nothing else but exposure

Responsibilities

Responsibilities that novices may be required to fulfil, but are unprepared for, include but are not limited to:
⦁ Reading, understanding, and preparing for work in complex repositories
⦁ How to prepare work for Pull Request / Code Review (PR/CR), and how to perform them
⦁ Testing code
⦁ Using and progressing work through different environments / servers
⦁ Initialising working environments on own machine to fit in with employer / co-workers
⦁ How to use Agile / Kanban - taking tickets and writing them

Scenarios

Scenarios that novices may have to deal with, but are unprepared for, include but are not limited to:
⦁ Bugs in others' code
⦁ Code runs on co-worker's machines, but not theirs
⦁ Poor, lacking, or non-existent documentation
⦁ Unhelpful colleagues
⦁ Sprawling repos
⦁ Overwhelming information overload
⦁ Overwhelming work commitments

Intent

⦁ Create a resource to educate and allow practice of the above responsibilities and scenarios
⦁ Allow mentors and mentees to easily access this resource and identify where to find specific resources and activities to learn specific skills
⦁ Allow mentors and mentees to easily improve this resource via feedback and implementation of new features and fixes

Initial Ideas

⦁ A Meet-A-Mentor Github repository with multiple sub-projects
⦁ Sub-projects will have a story / ticket system with pieces of work in each
⦁ Sub-project difficulty will vary at least in terms of task, knowledge, research required, number of sources needing to be called upon, helpfulness and completeness of accompanying resources
⦁ A no-nonsense, 'what you need to know' approach to deciding what is most important for mentees to know
⦁ Mentees and mentors will have an identification number used in a branching scheme allowing work to be completed without overwriting the master branch of a project
⦁ Merging will require PR review
⦁ A plan to move towards as self-sustaining a model as possible
