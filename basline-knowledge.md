# Pre-requisite :books: :beginner:
The learner should have some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if youâ€™re coming from a different programming language.

  

 **HTML - An understanding of semantic markup.**
 
 Semantic markup is to use appropriate Hyper Text Markup Language tags  to describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them. It is a way to format the page for easier redability,  accessability and to give meaning to the content.
 
**CSS - A knowledge of specificity and selectors.**

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing page layouts, colors, and fonts thats has been written in a markup language (HTML/XML).
Using the HTML tags, this specifies which HTML element the CSS styling will effect.
CSS Specificity is the set of the rules applied to CSS selectors to apply styling to an element. The more specific a CSS style is, the more dominent it will be and likely to be present on the element's style.
CSS Specificity ensures that your code is organized, and your selectors won't conflict with one another.

**Javascrit - Familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays. Features from ES6, such as arrow functions and classes.**

JavaScript is a programming language that is used for web development, in web applications, games, and much more more.
When used with HTML and CSS, we can create and control dynamic web content.
The many things Javascript is use for are:
-   **Adding interactivity to websites**
-   **Developing mobile applications**
-   **Creating web browser based games**
-   **Back end web development**

Without JavaScript, a website is just a static page and will not be responsive.
