                    who is rejected by Victor and mankind in general.

                    Kafka on the Shore is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs
                    away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or
                    to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never
                    recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most
                    basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.

                    The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries.
                    Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it.
                    But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and
                    steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer -
                    to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.
