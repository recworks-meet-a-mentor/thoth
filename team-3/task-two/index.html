    WELCOME TO THE FRIENDS OF THE PARKLAND WALK
    The Parkland Walk is the longest linear nature reserve in London at 4km in length, and follows the former railway
    line connecting Finsbury Park to Alexandra Palace which opened in 1873. Its fame is now global as it often features
    on 'must do' lists for visitors from oversees. At times it can be quite busy and weekends bring walkers, dog
    walkers, runners and cyclists all out to take advantage of the weather and escape from the urban hullabaloo.

    Keep your eyes peeled for the many mini artworks created by local artist Ben Wilson - 'The Chewing Gum Man'. There
    are at least 35 pictures to be found, all reflecting the Parkland Walk's flora and fauna, it's past life as a
    railway line and also the users of the Walk. The Art Trail was created over the course of 2020 - through rain, shine
    and lockdown!

    The Wildlife Trail
    The Wildlife Trail is a small feature site at the Highgate End. It is now open to the public between 9.00am and
    6.00pm. Click on the Wildlife Trail link in the main menu to see more on this developing project.

    Our Volunteers
    We have a small but dedicated group of volunteers who come out to help us maintain and improve the ecology of the
    Walk. It's a big task that could benefit from more hands and we always welcome anyone who can help in any capacity.
    No knowledge of conservation is required, just the desire to want to help make The Parkland Walk a better place for
    everyone. Volunteering is a great way to make new friends, improve your health and fitness and also learn about the
    natural world.


    CONSERVATION DAYS AND LITTER PICKS
    Volunteering activities have recently been resumed. Please make sure you are signed up for our newsletters to hear
    updates on when our events are on. They usually take place on the second Saturday of the month 10.30 - 1.00.

    Litter picks are organised as volunteer events or you can become a 'Litter Marshal'. Litter marshals generally
    commit to carrying out a litter pick each week. If you wish to become a litter marshal please view our volunteering
    page and contact us so we can help you get set up.
