            <h1>WELCOME TO THE FRIENDS OF THE PARKLAND WALK</h1>

            <p>The Parkland Walk is the longest linear nature reserve in London at 4km in length, and follows the former
                railway line connecting Finsbury Park to Alexandra Palace which opened in 1873. Its fame is now global
                as it often features on 'must do' lists for visitors from oversees. At times it can be quite busy and
                weekends bring walkers, dog walkers, runners and cyclists all out to take advantage of the weather and
                escape from the urban hullabaloo.</p>



            <h4>An Art Trail</h4>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do68wjft3/image/upload/c_scale,h_384,w_717/v1616611536/Screenshot_2021-03-24_at_18.45.19_pwwhpt.png"
                alt="">
            <p>Keep your eyes peeled for the many mini artworks created by local artist Ben Wilson - 'The Chewing Gum
                Man'. There are at least 35 pictures to be found, all reflecting the Parkland Walk's flora and fauna,
                it's past life as a railway line and also the users of the Walk. The Art Trail was created over the
                course of 2020 - through rain, shine and lockdown!</p>

            <h4>The Wildlife Trail</h4>

            <p> The Wildlife Trail is a small feature site at the Highgate End. It is now open to the public between
                9.00am and 6.00pm. Click on the Wildlife Trail link in the main menu to see more on this developing
                project. </p>


            <h4>Our Volunteers</h4>
            <p>We have a small but dedicated group of volunteers who come out to help us maintain and improve the
                ecology of the Walk. It's a big task that could benefit from more hands and we always welcome anyone who
                can help in any capacity. No knowledge of conservation is required, just the desire to want to help make
                The Parkland Walk a better place for everyone. Volunteering is a great way to make new friends, improve
                your health and fitness and also learn about the natural world.</p>


            <h1>CONSERVATION DAYS AND LITTER PICKS</h1>

            <p>Volunteering activities have recently been resumed. Please make sure you are signed up for our
                newsletters to hear updates on when our events are on. They usually take place on the second Saturday of
                the month 10.30 - 1.00.</p>

            <p>Litter picks are organised as volunteer events or you can become a 'Litter Marshal'. Litter marshals
                generally commit to carrying out a litter pick each week. If you wish to become a litter marshal please
                view our volunteering page and contact us so we can help you get set up. </p>
