Add a navigation bar at the top of the page in a style and layout that you think is suitable.
Tasks:

- Find a way to summarise the navigation section on the left, for instance you could have a heading of 'Animals' with a dropdown instead of seperate sections for birds and butterflies
- The navbar should be responsive and condense to a burger icon with a dropdown on mobile
- Link to the extra 'art-trail' you've already created, but leave the rest of the headings without links for the time being.
- Keep the navbar in the style of the page

Acceptance Criteria

- A navbar is created at the top of the page that sensibly lays out the possible links, is not overly cramped, and is responsive.
- A link to 'art-trail' is included.
- it can be in any style but should match the font/color theme of the site.
