 
* To help novices navigate the world of working in software development
* To help mentors prepare novice mentees for working in software development

## Assumption
Novices have reasonable coding skills in their chosen language(s) - or there are numerous mature, free resources in order to be able to attain coding skills – so focus need not be on the coding aspect.

However, the peripheral skills needed to transition into the workplace might not be known.  The requisite skills need to be 

* Identified
* Prioritised
* Practiced 


And this is the problem that Thoth aims to solve!
Provide novices with a narrow shortlist of peripheral skills, prioritised, along with a framework of resources/support to gain practical experience. The aim to help them to get to the workplace faster and with confidence.

## Objectives
1. Thoth aims to provide a mentee looking for a specific job role (e.g. Front-End web-developer] with a validated roadmap of prioritised skills split by  sub-domain.

2. Thoth, in each sub-domain, will identify essential skills and direct mentees to a recommended learning resource/s. The intent is that these resources are linked to help solve a chosen assignment. 

3. Mentee to be assigned/choose tasks on Thoth project that touch on learning these skills to gain practical experience.

4. Thoth does not aim to generate material for study but rather to assist mentees' by directing the towards suitable pre-exisiting learning resources.
 
5. Thoth to provide links/introductions to Mentors/Champions in each domain that volunteer to give guidance as and when necessary. A support framework. Feedback from Mentor to Mentee



One way we might implement this…

1. Perhaps identify a job role such as Web Developer, Back-End Developer (Entry Level) etc...
2. In the group, determine the short list of skills that would be highly desirable when you land the role to produce a couple of maps (as above)
3. Ask for ideas, resources where mentees' can learn, practice these essential skills and how they might be able to evidence competence –
4. Ask for volunteer champions to support sub-domains
